Hi, I'm Curtis-Thomas!

I'm a software developer currently working with React and MERN stack.

My Current Projects:


[free-api-list-with-react](https://freeapilist.com/))

An open-source GitHub repository with a collection of free API resources. The project provides a curated list of usable endpoints organized into different categories and includes tools to test them. The front-end is built with React and Material UI.

Curtis-Thomas/Curtis-Thomas is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
